# countryREST
Task for Daftcode Indoorway Internship. Simple iOS app presenting world countries.

Features:
------------
* Navigation Controller
* Table View as a main screen, shows list of countries with possibility of refreshing by pulling table down.
* Search Bar refining elements of table.
* Details View presented when table element is clicked consisting of flag presented by WKWebView, Map View with location and few informations presented by labels.
Notes:
------------
* I've used WKWebView to present .svg file provided by api, becouse swift provides no native svg handling and I wanted to keep this project pods free for sake of simplicity.
